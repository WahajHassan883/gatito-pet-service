          Gatito was founded by two married couples who envisioned a pet care
          service that goes beyond the ordinary. From the outset, our mission
          has been clear: to provide pets with the same level of love,
          attention, and care they receive from their own families. What started
          as a small endeavor fueled by enthusiasm quickly grew into something
          more significant. With a handful of loyal clients who entrusted us
          with the well-being of their furry companions, we embarked on a
          journey to make a positive impact in the lives of pets and their
          owners alike.
